b'Facebook said it would roll out a centralized system for its users to control their privacy and security settings in response to an outcry over the way it has handled personal data.The system, which will be introduced to Facebook users globally over the coming weeks, will allow people to change their privacy and security settings from one place rather than having to go to roughly 20 separate sections across the social media platform.From the new page, users can control the personal information the social network keeps on them, such as their political preferences or interests, and download and review a file of data Facebook has collected about them. Facebook also will clarify what types of apps people are currently using and what permissions those apps have to gather their information.Facebook began developing the centralized system last year but sped it up after revelations that a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, improperly harvested the information of 50 million users of the social network. The amount of data Cambridge Analytica obtained about Facebook users reawakened fears over how much information the social network has gathered about people, leading to a #DeleteFacebook movement and other criticism.The last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies, and to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data, Erin Egan, Facebooks chief privacy officer, and Ashlie Beringer, a Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement announcing the new system. Weve heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find, and that we must do more to keep people informed.The Cambridge Analytica scandal has plunged Facebook into its worst crisis in years, with regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Britain demanding answers about how the social network deals with data privacy. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebooks chief executive, has agreed to appear in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill next month, people familiar with the decision have said.Last week, Mr. Zuckerberg said in a statement that Facebook had to do better with user data and promised to roll out products that give users more control over their information and privacy settings.One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data, he told The New York Times last week. Whenever theres an issue where someones data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldnt have allowed it to, thats rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar.Late Wednesday, Facebook also said that it was halting its practice of allowing advertisers to target ads using information from third-party data brokers. These are business-to-business companies that can collect a vast range of details about individual consumers such as their shopping habits, health concerns, income range and preferred credit card.The social network had previously allowed advertisers to use consumer details from data brokers like Experian, Acxiom and Oracles Datalogix unit to help target ads to Facebook users. But Facebook said it was now mothballing that option, called Partner Categories.We want to let advertisers know that we will be shutting down Partner Categories, Graham Mudd, a product marketing director at Facebook, said in a statement.This product enables third-party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook, he added. While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve peoples privacy on Facebook.In 2012, the Federal Trade Commission opened an inquiry into data brokers and subsequently recommended that Congress consider enacting a law to make data broker practices more visible to consumers and to give consumers greater control over the immense amounts of personal information about them collected and shared by data brokers.How much of a difference these actions may make to Facebooks data privacy practices was unclear. Some privacy advocates noted, for instance, that the companys new centralized privacy and security settings page has been tried in the past.The platform made similar promises many times before, said Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina who studies how technology affects society. She pointed out that in 2010, Mr. Zuckerberg said in The Washington Post that Facebook users needed simpler controls over their privacy and had promised then that Facebook would add privacy controls that are much simpler to use.Yet eight years later, the same concerns have resurfaced, Ms. Tufekci said.The past decade shows that user concerns over privacy appear to have little teeth on changing how the platform behaves, aside from a recycling of contrite statements and promises to do better from its C.E.O., she said.'
