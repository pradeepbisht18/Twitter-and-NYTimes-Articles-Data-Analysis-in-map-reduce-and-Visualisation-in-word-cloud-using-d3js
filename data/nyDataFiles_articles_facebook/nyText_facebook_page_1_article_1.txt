b' (Want to get this briefing by email? Heres the sign-up.)Good morning.Heres what you need to know: More than a decade ago, Facebook opened itself to the world, inviting developers to build apps and programs on top of the social networks platform.Millions of third-party apps have been created since then, and the consequences of Facebooks loose approach to the collection of user data are becoming clear, our tech columnist writes.As Facebook grapples with questions about its role in the spread of disinformation, the companys chief information security officer is said to be leaving. The executive, Alex Stamos, had pushed for more transparency but met resistance from other senior leaders, according to current and former employees. Cambridge Analytica, the political data firm that harvested information from more than 50 million Facebook profiles, also sought to entrap politicians with sex or bribes, according to an investigation in Britain that included a journalist posing as a prospective client. A male student opened fire at a high school in Southern Maryland today, injuring two students and exchanging gunfire with an officer at the school, the police said. The suspect was later confirmed dead. The shooting comes just over a month after 14 students and three adults were killed at a high school in Parkland, Fla. Last year, we wrote about how Arizonas promise to keep the self-driving car industry free of regulations attracted dozens of companies, including Lyft, Uber and Waymo.That lack of oversight is among the factors under scrutiny after an autonomous car operated by Uber  killed a woman in Tempe, Ariz. It is believed to be the first pedestrian death associated with self-driving technology on a public road. Supporters say the cars will ultimately be safer than regular vehicles because they take easily distracted humans out of the equation. But the relatively new technology is only starting to experience the unpredictable situations that drivers can face. The authorities are trying to determine whether a package that exploded early today at a FedEx distribution center near San Antonio was linked to four recent bombings in Austin.The latest explosion, in Schertz, Tex., lightly injured one employee, law enforcement officials said. The package was addressed to an Austin destination, according to local news reports. A serial bomber  is being sought in Austin after a string of explosions that have killed two people and wounded four. For weeks, the international news media has shown images of wounded children and throngs of refugees fleeing the Syrian militarys offensive in a rebel-held suburb of Damascus.This week, the government hit back with videos showing President Bashar al-Assad visiting the area to congratulate his forces and to greet cheering residents. Our correspondent reports: Mr. Assad delivered an alternative view of the war, one in which he is assured and in charge, casually cruising past bombed-out buildings, often driving with just two fingers, an elbow propped casually out the window. It is a world in which his opponents are all terrorists and his troops all heroes.

Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, is facing requests from several countries for exemptions from steel and aluminum tariffs.
