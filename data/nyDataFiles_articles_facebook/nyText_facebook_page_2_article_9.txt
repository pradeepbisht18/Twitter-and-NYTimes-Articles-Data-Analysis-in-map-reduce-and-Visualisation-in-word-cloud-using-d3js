b'NEW YORK   The Latest on Facebook\'s privacy scandal (all times local):2:30 p.m.Facebook has been secretly deleting some messages CEO Mark Zuckerberg sent through its Messenger application, an option that hasn\'t been available to most of the social network\'s 2.2 billion users.The company says it has been removing Zuckerberg\'s messages from the inboxes of various people for several years. The recipients of Zuckerberg\'s messages weren\'t informed before that happened. Facebook is making the acknowledgement Friday after TechCrunch first reported the tactic.Facebook says it began erasing the messages of Zuckerberg and a few other top executives in 2014 after computer hackers obtained and released emails from Sony Pictures executives. The Sony messages included disparaging remarks about movie stars and other people in the entertainment industry.Although the ability to automatically delete sent texts hadn\'t been previously available, Facebook says it now plans to make it available to all users. The company apologized for not doing so sooner.The development comes as Facebook faces questions about trust in light of one of its worst privacy scandals in its 14-year history.___2 p.m.Facebook says it will require advertisers who want to run either political ads or so-called "issue ads" which may not endorse a specific candidate or party but which discuss political topics to verify themselves.Facebook is working to strengthen its system ahead of this year\'s U.S. midterm elections and other elections around the world. The company has already required political ads to verify who is paying for them and where the advertiser is located. The requirement for issue ads is new.In addition, Facebook says it will also require the administrators of pages with a "large number" of followers to verify their identities and addresses. The company did not specify what number of followers would trigger the requirement.The moves are intended to clamp down on fake pages and accounts such as those used to disrupt the 2016 presidential elections in the U.S. and elsewhere.___1:15 p.m.Facebook will begin alerting users whose private data may have been compromised in the Cambridge Analytica scandal starting Monday.All 2.2 billion Facebook users will receive a notice on their feeds titled "Protecting Your Information."
